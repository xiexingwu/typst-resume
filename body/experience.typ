=== Most important role #h(1fr) #Dates(icon:"")[2025]
This part of the resume layout is the `core`.
This block of content is intended for important content that looks nice when it's only a bit wider than half the page width.

- The dates next to the above subheadings are created using the `Date` component.


=== Least important role #h(1fr) #Dates(icon:none)[2023][2024]
By default, only `experience.typ` is included into the `core` block.
Feel free to include content from other files here too.
